# Website-Visit-Automation
Python script that will automatically open up websites when I start my computer up. 

My main goal for this project is to automate opening the websites I commonly use when I start up my computer. To do this I am planning on creating a task through task scheduler on Windows. Ideally when my computer starts up it will run the task which will run the script and open the websites.
